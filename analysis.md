Credit Score Distribution Summary
After running the clustering and scoring model on the Aave V2 wallet transaction dataset, each wallet was assigned a credit score between 0 and 1000. The scores were based on how each wallet interacted with the protocol — such as deposit frequency, borrowing behavior, repayments, and total value moved.

The clustering algorithm grouped the wallets into five behavioral segments. These segments were then mapped to scores like 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000. This allowed us to place wallets into score bands such as 0–199, 200–399, and so on.

In terms of overall distribution, most wallets fell into the middle score ranges, with fewer wallets in the extreme low or high ranges.

Behavior of Wallets with Lower Scores (0–399)
Wallets in the lowest score ranges typically showed very limited or narrow activity on the Aave protocol. Many had only performed a single action such as depositing once or borrowing a very small amount without meaningful follow-up.

Some of these wallets also lacked any signs of responsible behavior — for example, they had borrowings without evidence of repayments, no collateral, or very minimal interaction with other tokens or assets.

It is likely that this group includes wallets used for testing, bots, or users who interacted with the protocol only briefly or in a suspicious pattern.

Behavior of Wallets with Medium Scores (400–599)
Wallets in this category showed moderate engagement with the protocol. They had some deposits, borrowings, and repayments, but the activity was not very frequent or consistent.

These users might be occasional DeFi participants or still experimenting with how the protocol works. Their transaction history is not risky, but it does not indicate deep or regular use of the platform either.

In most cases, these wallets demonstrated average credit behavior — not harmful, but not particularly strong either.

Behavior of Wallets with High Scores (600–1000)
The highest scoring wallets had the most reliable and consistent activity. These wallets showed healthy signs of interaction such as frequent deposits, use of collateral, responsible borrowing, and timely repayments.

They also tended to engage with a wider variety of tokens and actions, suggesting familiarity with the Aave protocol and more confidence in using DeFi products.

Such wallets are likely long-term users or power users, and their behavior indicates low risk and high responsibility in terms of borrowing and asset management.

Final Observations
Overall, the scoring system reflects real behavioral trends in the data. Wallets that used the platform responsibly and regularly were rewarded with high scores, while those with erratic, low, or minimal usage patterns received lower scores.

This approach can help identify which wallets are trustworthy and which ones may require further review or caution — especially useful for financial protocols looking to build credit-based systems or loyalty programs in a decentralized environment.
